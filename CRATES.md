# WINTS

You may have a lot of URLs for a lot of context.

If the question is **What I Need To See in this context?**, then the answer is `wints`.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install wints
```

## Usage

You can test it with

- `wints crate` to open **THIS** url
- `wints issues` to open the issues of the `wints` **repository**

Fuzzy-matching is also possible,

- `wints repo` will only open all URLs related to `wints` **repository**

To known more, you can run `wints usage` to go to the [Usage guide](https://github.com/rlespinasse/wints/blob/v0.x/USAGE.adoc).

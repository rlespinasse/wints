You may have a lot of URLs for a lot of context.

If the question is **What I Need To See in this context?**, then the answer is `wints`.

## Installation

* Via {cargo-installation}[Cargo]
+
[source,shell]
----
cargo install wints
----

* Build Manually
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:rlespinasse/wints.git ~/.wints
cd ~/.wints
cargo install --path .
cargo build --release
# put the resulting `target/release/wints` executable on your PATH.
----

## Usage

To run, `wints` need a `.wints.yaml` file like this default one (generated when missing)

[source,yaml]
----
---
elements:
  - context: repository code
    urls:
      - https://github.com/rlespinasse/wints
  - context: repository issues
    urls:
      - https://github.com/rlespinasse/wints/issues
----

So when you run

- `wints repository` will open all urls
- `wints issues` will only open the urls on **repository issues** context

Fuzzy-matching is also possible,

- `wints repo code` will only open the urls on **repository code** context

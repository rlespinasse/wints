You may have a lot of URLs for a lot of context.

If the question is **What I Need To See in this context?**, then the answer is `wints`.

== Installation

* Via {cargo-installation}[Cargo]
+
[source,shell]
----
cargo install wints
----

* Build Manually
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:rlespinasse/wints.git ~/.wints
cd ~/.wints
cargo install --path .
cargo build --release
# put the resulting `target/release/wints` executable on your PATH.
----

== Usage

You can test it with

- `wints crate` to open the url to `wints` as a Rust crate
- `wints issues` to open the issues of the `wints` **repository**

Fuzzy-matching is also possible,

- `wints repo` will only open all URLs related to `wints` **repository**

To known more, you can run `wints usage` to go to the link:USAGE.adoc[Usage guide].
